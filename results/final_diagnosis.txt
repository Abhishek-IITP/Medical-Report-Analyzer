Final Diagnosis:

* **Anxiety-related disorders**: The patient's symptoms of dizziness, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort may be exacerbated or triggered by anxiety, as noted by both the Cardiologist and Psychologist reports. The Psychologist report also suggests that the patient's anxiety may be contributing to her fatigue and overall sense of well-being.
* **Cardiac arrhythmias or structural abnormalities**: The Cardiologist report suggests that the patient's palpitations may be indicative of an underlying cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation or supraventricular tachycardia, and that a mitral valve prolapse could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The recommended Holter monitor and echocardiogram with stress test will help to evaluate the patient's heart rhythm and detect any potential arrhythmias or structural abnormalities.
* **Obstructive or restrictive lung disease**: The Pulmonologist report suggests that the patient's shortness of breath and chest discomfort may be related to asthma or other obstructive lung diseases, and recommends pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to assess for obstructive or restrictive lung disease. The patient's symptoms and the Pulmonologist's recommendations suggest that an underlying respiratory issue may be contributing to the patient's overall health issues.
