Final Diagnosis:

* **Anxiety-related disorders**: The patient's reported stress during exams and symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps may be contributing to anxiety-related cardiac issues, as mentioned in the Cardiologist Report, and the Psychologist Report also suggests that the patient may be experiencing anxiety, which could be contributing to her physical symptoms.
* **Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) or other cardiac issues**: The Cardiologist Report suggests that the patient may be experiencing symptoms related to MVP, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps, particularly during times of stress or hormonal changes, and recommends further testing to rule out any underlying cardiac issues.
* **Orthostatic Intolerance or Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction**: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps could be related to orthostatic intolerance, as mentioned in the Cardiologist Report, which may be caused by autonomic nervous system dysfunction, and the Psychologist Report also suggests that the patient may be experiencing stress and anxiety, which could be contributing to autonomic nervous system dysfunction.
